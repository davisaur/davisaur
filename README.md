# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
My name is davi! 
I'm a Software Engineering Student by day, Video Editor for content creators by night.

* *Currently*: BSc Software Engineering Student @ **University of Brighton**

# ðŸŽ¬ Video Editing

I've dabbled in video editing since I was about 9-10, originally inspired by the use of After Effects from [Mumbo Jumbo](http://youtube.com/@MumboJumbo) who was way ahead of his time, and around 2020, I managed to start editing publicly for other creators, with the help of [NoGoodDavis](http://twitter.com/NoGoodDavis) and [Caru](http://twitter.com/caru).

I currently edit for the likes of:

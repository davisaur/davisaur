# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
My name is davi! 
I'm a Software Engineering Student by day, Video Editor for content creators by night.

* *Currently*: BSc Software Engineering Student @ **University of Brighton**

# ðŸŽ¬ Video Editing

I've dabbled in video editing since I was about 9-10, originally inspired by the use of After Effects, by fellow content creator going under the name, [Mumbo Jumbo](http://youtube.com/@ThatMumboJumbo), whose content was way ahead of the time a few years back. 

Fast forward to around 2020, I started work on my portfolio. And with the help of [NoGoodDavis](http://twitter.com/NoGoodDavis) and [Caru](http://twitter.com/caru), I managed to get my head start making TikToks for a couple of gaming-focused content creators.

## Nowadays, I mostly edit for:
* **[jschlatt](http://youtube.com/c/jschlattLive/)**: A content creator who previously focused on [tier list videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxI-Ob8lpLE), ranking [people's setups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIjH5DaySuo) and TikToks and playing popular Wii Games. Nowadays, he focuses on creating more IRL content, like [going to Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTDimRi2_TQ) and vlogging his experience there, going out to Circuit of the Americas and [racing in a Porsche 911](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHtCHFqTQTY), etc.
* **[Weest](http://youtube.com/c/Weest/)**: A Streamer who mainly focuses on reviewing other peoples wretched ["Coom Caves"/"Discord Dungeons"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4AlI4ZXgM), playing a variety of different [bingo games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLbDOfDv7Bs) with viewers at home, and playing [You Laugh You Lose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ7Zug37jOY).
* **[Fundy](http://youtube.com/c/Fundy/)**: A Minecraft creator who creates [wacky, fun mods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shRrnUQyE54) that change the game mechanics [cool/annoying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYglW2wOQw) ways.
